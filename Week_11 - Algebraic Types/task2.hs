{-
Define a new polymorphic algebraic data type called `Shape`.

For it define the constructors:
- `Circle` with one argument representing the radius;
- `Rectangle` with two arguments representing the width and height;
- `Triangle`;
- `Cylinder` with two arguments for the radius of the base and height.

Use the typeclasses `Show`, `Eq`, `Ord`, `Read`.
Create a shape from every type and output it.
