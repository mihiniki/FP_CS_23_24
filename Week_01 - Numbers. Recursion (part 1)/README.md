## Task 1

The Euclidean Algorithm for finding `GCD(x,y)` is as follows:

    If x = 0 then GCD(x,y)=y.
    If y = 0 then GCD(x,y)=x.
    Write x in quotient remainder form (x = Aâ‹…y + R). Find GCD(y,R) (since GCD(x,y)=GCD(y,R)).

Using the above algorithm, define a procedure for calculating the GCD of two numbers.

> **Implementation detail**: Use guards!

    (= (my-gcd 13 1235) 13)

## Task 2

Define two predicates that check whether a year is a leap year.

The first should be called *leap-year-one-line?*. It should implement *Method I* using **boolean logical operators**.

The second should be called *is-leap-year-guards?*. It should implement *Method II* using **guards**.

Recap:

    Method I: A year is leap year if it is a multiple of 400 or it is a multiple of 4 but not of 100.

    Method II:
        if year is divisible by 400 then is_leap_year
        else if year is divisible by 100 then not_leap_year
        else if year is divisible by 4 then is_leap_year
        else not_leap_year 

Test cases:

    (equal? (leap-year-one-line? 2020) #t)
    (equal? (leap-year-one-line? 1988) #t)
    (equal? (leap-year-one-line? 1600) #t)
    (equal? (leap-year-one-line? 2400) #t)
    (equal? (leap-year-one-line? 2023) #f)
    (equal? (leap-year-one-line? 1700) #f)
    (equal? (leap-year-one-line? 1800) #f)
    (equal? (leap-year-one-line? 2100) #f)

    (equal? (is-leap-year-guards? 2020) #t)
    (equal? (is-leap-year-guards? 1988) #t)
    (equal? (is-leap-year-guards? 1600) #t)
    (equal? (is-leap-year-guards? 2400) #t)
    (equal? (is-leap-year-guards? 2023) #f)
    (equal? (is-leap-year-guards? 1700) #f)
    (equal? (is-leap-year-guards? 1800) #f)
    (equal? (is-leap-year-guards? 2100) #f)

## Task 3

John has a backpack. With it he can carry *k* kilograms. An item from the supermarket weighs *w* kilograms.

Define a predicate that accepts three numbers - *c* (number of products), *k* and *w* and returns whether John is capable of buying all the products in one trip to the supermarket.

> **Implementation detail**: Use **guards** and make sure to throw **errors**!

Test cases:

    (equal? (can-carry? 5 15 3) #t)
    (equal? (can-carry? 1 5 4) #t)
    (equal? (can-carry? 13 25 2) #f)
    (equal? (can-carry? 24 104.44 21.12) #f)
    (equal? (can-carry? 51 34.75 19.852) #f)
    (equal? (can-carry? 42 95.11 0.51) #t)

    ; (can-carry? -13 25 2) ; error: The number of products was negative
    ; (can-carry? 13 -25 2) ; error: John's hosting capacity was negative
    ; (can-carry? 13 25 -2) ; error: The weight of a product was negative

## Task 4

Each **day** a plant is growing by *up-speed* meters. Each **night** that plants height decreases by *down-speed* meters due to the lack of sun light. Initially, plant is 0 meters tall. We plant the seed at the beginning of a day. We want to know how many days it will take for the plant to reach a certain height.

Test cases:

    (= (growing-plant 5 2 5) 1)
    (= (growing-plant 5 2 6) 2)
    (= (growing-plant 10 9 4) 1)
    (= (growing-plant 100 10 910) 10) ; up-speed=100, down-speed=10, desired-height=910

Explanations:

- For up-speed = 100, down-speed = 10 and desired-height = 910, the output should be 10.

        After day 1   --> 100
        After night 1 --> 90
        After day 2   --> 190
        After night 2 --> 180
        After day 3   --> 280
        After night 3 --> 270
        After day 4   --> 370
        After night 4 --> 360
        After day 5   --> 460
        After night 5 --> 450
        After day 6   --> 550
        After night 6 --> 540
        After day 7   --> 640
        After night 7 --> 630
        After day 8   --> 730
        After night 8 --> 720
        After day 9   --> 820
        After night 9 --> 810
        After day 10  --> 910 

- For up-speed = 10, down-speed = 9 and desired-height = 4, the output should be 1 because the plant reaches the desired height at day 1 (10 meters).

        After day 1 --> 10

## Task 5

A snail crawls up a column. During the day it crawls up some distance. During the night it sleeps, so it slides down for some distance (less than it crawls up during the day).

Your procedure accepts three arguments:

- The height of the column;
- The distance that the snail crawls during the day;
- The distance that the snail slides down during the night.

Calculate number of days the snail will need to reach the top of the column.

Test cases:

    (= (snail 3 2 1) 2)
    (= (snail 10 3 1) 5)
    (= (snail 10 3 2) 8)
    (= (snail 100 20 5) 7)
    (= (snail 5 10 3) 1)

## Task 6

Define a procedure that reverses a **non-negative** number by implementing a **linearly iterative process**.

Test cases:

    (= (rev 1) 1)
    (= (rev 123) 321)
    (= (rev 987654321) 123456789)
