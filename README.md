# Functional Programming, Computer Science, Winter Semester 2023-2024

## Algorithm for solving exercises

1. What is the name of the procedure/function?
2. How many parameters does it take?
3. What is the type of the parameters?
4. What are the names of the parameters?
5. What is the return type?
6. Break the task into smaller tasks. List them.

## In case of an error in Haskell

- check whitespace (space, tab, etc.)
- remove/comment out declaration
- new algorithm

## In case of an error in Racket

- check procedure application => should be prefix
- procedure <=> parenthesis
- new algorithm
